# deeparpes
Autoencoder-based deep learning software for analysis of Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES)

This is a repotory designed to suppoert autoencoder anaylsis of spacially-resolved ARPES imaging. The reposetory is currently uncompleted, please refer to the Colab file for current usage. Follow the below guidelines on the Colab File:

1. Run installations and drive loading, and ensure your datafiles (.h5) are uploaded to the relevent drive
2. If the usage of deep learning instead of iEDC/iADC/PCA clustering is warrented, run the Deep Autoencoder Training cells with approriate presets for the 'gen' function, which determines the training dataset.
3. Run the "Setup" section
4. Choose to import testing data with the "Generation of Artificial Stress-Test Data" block or your own custum data from the next section
5. Explore the visualization options.
